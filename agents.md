# LQS Project Agent Configuration

## Critical Behavioral Guidelines
- NEVER claim success without console evidence of HTTP 200 responses
- ALWAYS scan screenshots for error text (Failed, Error, 404, 500) before status reports
- MANDATORY browser console screenshots for API-related verification
- NO optimistic reporting when visual evidence shows failures

## Authentication Requirements
- Maintain client_id field consistency throughout codebase
- Provide browser console evidence for all API testing
- Screenshot error scanning required before success claims
